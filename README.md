| 1 | Hack 4: RGB Values with an Image.  Make journal entries and do corrections in code.   Backend... image files are really big, this would make a Programmer consider being efficiency in programming.  What are the calculations?  Could the image.py function "def image_data" more efficient?  There is a science to writing efficient algorithms called Big O notation (Links to an external site.). Write image_data function to be more efficient according to Big O notation.

## Ideas:
  
  
* Planner (School, Work, Personal)

We want to create a efficient and aesthetically nice planner that can be used for anything (School, Work, Personal). Typically, the reason we do not use planners are becauses they are hassle to set up and use, but we want to change that with our project

Have dropdown for different classes, jobs, times, etc.

Pictures to match with tasks

Simple set up of time slots and several buttons for flexibility
