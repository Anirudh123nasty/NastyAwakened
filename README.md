## Ideas:
* Planner (School, Work, Personal)

We want to create a efficient and aesthetically nice planner that can be used for anything (School, Work, Personal). Typically, the reason we do not use planners are becauses they are hassle to set up and use, but we want to change that with our project

Have dropdown for different classes, jobs, times, etc.

Pictures to match with tasks

Simple set up of time slots and several buttons for flexibility
